# Project Description

EasyFilecoin is a cross platform graphical client for Filecoin node. 

The installation and operation of  Filecoin is too complicated for most people. It is difficult to install packages on a Linux or macOS host using the command line and resolve potential software conflicts. Non-professional users are more willing to use graphical software. 

EasyFilecoin would simplify installation, upgrade and configuration of Filecoin node. It provides a clean interface and a series of scripts that interact with Filecoin nodes.

## Value

The Filecoin network requires enough nodes to provide value. EasyFilecoin provides a quick way to participate in the Filecoin network and should speed up the popularity of Filecoin.

As EasyFilecoin is just a graphical client, if the project fails, Filecoin network will not be affected.

The main risks are the technical difficulties and the large workload brought by cross-platform development.

## Deliverables

Graphical client of Filecoin node working on multi platforms which are Linux, macOSOS and Windows. 

Graphical interface of installation and configuration. Users can choose where software will be installed and how much disk space the node uses.

Graphical interface for the creation, backup, and use of Filecoin wallets.

Graphical interface for the Filecoin mining operation including starting, stopping, etc.

## Development Roadmap

We split the development process into three phases.

| No.  | Software Functionality                                       | Staff | Funding | Estimated Timeframe    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| 1    | EasyFilecoin Linux version:<br />Graphical interface of installation and configuration.<br />Graphical interface for the creation, backup, and use of Filecoin wallets.<br /><br />Graphical interface for the Filecoin mining operation. | 2     | 0       | 10/1/2019 - 12/31/2020 |
| 2    | EasyFilecoin macOSOS version:<br />Graphical interface of installation and configuration.<br />Graphical interface for the creation, backup, and use of Filecoin wallets.<br /><br />Graphical interface for the Filecoin mining operation. | 2     | $12000  | 1/1/2020 - 1/31/2020   |
| 3    | EasyFilecoin Windows version:<br />Graphical interface of installation and configuration.<br />Graphical interface for the creation, backup, and use of Filecoin wallets.<br /><br />Graphical interface for the Filecoin mining operation. | 2     | $6000   | 2/1/2020 - 3/31/2020   |

We will invest the longest time in the first milestone. In order to prove our ability and reduce the risk of the Filecoin Foundation, we do not apply for funding at the beginning of the first milestone. Only when we have completed the first phase will we apply for funding of milestone 1 and 2  at the beginning of the second phase.

The progress of the second phase will be accelerated due to previously work in the first phase. EasyFilecoin Linux version and macOS version would be released on the date when Filecoin main network be available.

The third milestone is the most technically risky because Filecoin currently does not have a native Windows program. So we will spend twice the time of phase 2 at this stage and do our best to make EasyFilecoin available on Windows via  container technology.

At each stage we provide installation packages, documentation and Q&A sets for end users.

Detailed development plan.
